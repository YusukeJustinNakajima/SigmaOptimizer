## 🎯 Overview  
**SigmaOptimizer** is a **Sigma rule generation and optimization tool** that automatically creates, tests, and improves Sigma rules based on real-world logs using **LLM**.  
It is implemented as a PowerShell script and **integrates log analysis, rule evaluation, and iterative refinement** to enhance detection capabilities.  

✅ **Automated Sigma rule generation**  
✅ **Rule validation with syntax checks (Invoke-SigmaRuleTests)**  
✅ **Detection rate measurement using [Hayabusa](https://github.com/Yamato-Security/hayabusa)**  
✅ **FP check of created rules using [evtx-baseline](https://github.com/NextronSystems/evtx-baseline)**  
✅ **Command obfuscation support ([Invoke-ArgFuscator](https://github.com/wietze/Invoke-ArgFuscator)) for robust detection**

## 📜 Background
🔹 LLM-based Sigma rule creation has inherent limitations. When generating rules solely based on user prompts, without analyzing real-world logs, **hallucinations are more likely to occur.** More importantly, because the rules are not grounded in the actual log events generated by the malicious behavior they aim to detect, they risk being **unreliable and lacking robustness**..  
🔹 **Threat reports are typically published some time after an attack has occurred.** If Sigma rules are created based on these reports, **the time lag may result in incidents** occurring before adequate detection measures are in place. To mitigate this risk, **it is essential to actively execute malware samples and exploited red team tools to generate and refine Sigma rules based on real-world logs.**  
🔹 **Rule creation and validation are often separate processes**, meaning even improved rules need to be re-validated manually, which is inefficient.  
🔹 **Creating effective Sigma rules requires a deep understanding of threats.** While it's possible to create rules with limited knowledge, such rules are **easily bypassed by attackers** due to their simplicity.

## ✨ Features  
🔹 **End-to-end rule creation, syntax validation, detection testing, and improvement** in a single workflow.  
🔹 **Log-based rule generation**, rather than relying on user prompts, ensuring rules align with actual system events.  
🔹 **Automated command obfuscation support**, allowing rules to be more resilient against evasion techniques.  
🔹 **Reducing hallucinations through multiple validation mechanisms**

## 🚀 Usage  
### 🔧 Prerequisites   
- **Windows environment**  
- **PowerShell 5.1 or later**  
- **Run `AutoSetup.ps1` to automate the entire setup process. This script handles all the necessary preparations seamlessly. Before executing the script, update the `OPENAI_APIKEY` section in `AutoSetup.ps1` with your own API key.**
    - Installing Required PowerShell Modules
        - `Pester` (for running tests)  
        - `powershell-yaml` (for parsing YAML files)  
        - `Invoke-ArgFuscator` (for command obfuscation) 
    - Downloading and Setting Up Hayabusa
        - The script automatically downloads the latest Hayabusa release from GitHub.
    - Extracting the Archive
        - The script ensures the benign_evtx_logs/win10-client.tgz file is extracted
        - The default setting only checks false positives (FP) using the normal logs obtained in a Windows 10 client environment.
        - If needed, add your own logs according to your environment(or use [evtx-baseline](https://github.com/NextronSystems/evtx-baseline))
- **Recommended to configure the following two log sources to create better sigma rules:**
    - Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational -> Sysmon installation
    - Security EventID:4688 -> https://learn.microsoft.com/ja-jp/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/component-updates/command-line-process-auditing

### 🏁 Execution Steps  
1. **Launch Powershell with administrative privileges**

2. **Run the script**  
    ```powershell
    .\SigmaOptimizer.ps1
    ```

3. **Select execution environment**  
    ```
    Choose execution environment (ps for PowerShell, cmd for CMD)
    ```

4. **Enter the command to execute**  
    ```
    Enter the command to execute
    ```

5. **Select Log Source**
    ```
    Select the log sources to use:
    1. Application
    2. Security
    3. System
    4. Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
    
    Enter the numbers corresponding to the log sources you want to use, separated by commas (Press Enter for all)::
    ```
    
6. **Review generated Sigma rules**  
    - Rules are saved in `.yml` format under `rules/generate_rules/`.  

7. **Run detection test with Hayabusa**  
    - Enter `y` to execute Hayabusa and validate the rule.  
    ```
    Execute Hayabusa with this Sigma rule? (y/n)
    ```

8. **Generate new Sigma Rule based on previous rules**
   - Enter y to generate new rules.
    ```
    Generate new Sigma Rule based on previous rules? (y/n):
    ```
9. **Check False Positive for normal logs**
    - Enter y to check false positive.
    ```
    Check how much FP is generated by the rules you create? (y/n):
    ```

## 🔮 Future Work  
🔹 **Further optimization of Sigma rule generation**  
🔹 **Testing generalization performance (e.g., ensuring that rules created based on two obfuscation patterns also work against other obfuscation patterns).**  
🔹 **Additional syntax checks (e.g., preventing minor mistakes such as using contain instead of contains and automatically correcting small errors in the detection field).**  
🔹 **A machine learning-powered feature that filters distinctive logs to optimize LLM input and avoid rate limits.**
